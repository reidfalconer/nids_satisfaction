# Predicting Life Satisfaction with XGBoost

In this project we build a machine learning model that can be used to classify individuals life satisfcation using varibles in the National Income Dynamic Studies (NIDS) database.

[NIDS](http://www.nids.uct.ac.za/) is a face-to-face longitudinal survey of individuals and households living in South Africa and is the first 'nationally representative'  panel study that strives to document various changes over time in the income, expenditures, assets, access to services, education, health, agriculture and other dimensions of well-being of 11 895 households 

Specifically we employ the xgboost model (using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting package in R). The varibles chosen are stongly captured by the survey and thus contain few missing values. This is purely a trial run, and it may be the case that alternative ML algorithms and/or differnt data processing techniques that will yeild more accurate results
